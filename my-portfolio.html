       <h2>Work History and why Coding now.</h2>
      <p>For the past 16 years I have been working the in the food service industy from Seattle, WA to Portland, ME and Fort Collins, CO in between.The first 10 years I was in the restaurant industry. Started out working in the pantry at my first restaurant all the way up
        excutive Sous Chef. The last 6 years I have worked in the grocery, at Whole Foods Market and metropolitan market in the deli deparment. Manly doing prodution but whenever need I would do the special orders and Catering. After working so long in the food service industry I needed
        switch things for the better, so after hearing about Epicodus and doing a little bit a research I really feel in love with the idea fo coding, and I still get to be creative.
